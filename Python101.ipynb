It's also an approchable tool for learning data analysis in Python.  I'm using Google's version of Jupyter notebooks for this tutorial for ease of sharing, but you can also install it locally on your computer (pursuant to your agency's approval processes) using the [Anaconda distribution of Python](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/), which makes it easy to launch notebooks from a user-friendly interface."
